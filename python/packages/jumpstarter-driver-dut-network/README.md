# DUT Network Driver

`jumpstarter-driver-dut-network` provides network isolation for DUTs (Devices Under Test) by configuring a dedicated network interface with NAT, DHCP, and nftables-based firewall rules on the exporter host.

This enables scenarios where multiple DUTs share the same static IP configuration (common in automotive/embedded labs) by isolating each DUT behind its own NAT interface on the exporter.

## Installation

```shell
pip3 install --extra-index-url https://pkg.jumpstarter.dev/simple/ jumpstarter-driver-dut-network
```

### System Dependencies

The following must be available on the exporter host:

- `ip` (iproute2) - for interface management
- `nft` (nftables) - for NAT and firewall rules
- `dnsmasq` - for DHCP serving

Optional:
- `nmcli` (NetworkManager) - only needed if NM is running; the driver marks its interfaces as unmanaged

## Configuration

### Masquerade NAT (recommended for most use cases)

DUTs share the exporter's upstream IP when accessing the network:

```yaml
export:
  dut-network:
    type: jumpstarter_driver_dut_network.driver.DutNetwork
    config:
      interface: "eth2"
      subnet: "192.168.100.0/24"
      gateway_ip: "192.168.100.1"
      nat_mode: "masquerade"
      dhcp_enabled: true
      dhcp_range_start: "192.168.100.100"
      dhcp_range_end: "192.168.100.200"
      addresses:
        - mac: "8a:12:4e:25:f4:8e"
          ip: "192.168.100.10"
          hostname: "sa8775p"
      dns_servers: ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
```

### 1:1 NAT

Each DUT gets a dedicated public IP alias via a per-entry `public_ip` field, enabling inbound connections from the LAN. Entries without a `public_ip` fall back to masquerade for outbound traffic. Entries without a `mac` are used for 1:1 NAT mappings only and are excluded from DHCP static lease generation.

```yaml
export:
  dut-network:
    type: jumpstarter_driver_dut_network.driver.DutNetwork
    config:
      interface: "eth2"
      subnet: "192.168.100.0/24"
      gateway_ip: "192.168.100.1"
      upstream_interface: "enp2s0"
      nat_mode: "1to1"
      addresses:
        - mac: "8a:12:4e:25:f4:8e"
          ip: "192.168.100.10"
          hostname: "sa8775p-1"
          public_ip: "198.51.100.84"
        - mac: "8a:12:4e:25:f4:8f"
          ip: "192.168.100.11"
          hostname: "sa8775p-2"
          public_ip: "198.51.100.85"
        # Entry without MAC: 1:1 NAT mapping only, no DHCP static lease
        - ip: "192.168.100.12"
          hostname: "nxp-board-03"
          public_ip: "198.51.100.86"
```

### VLAN sub-interfaces and policy-based routing

When an address entry sets `vlan_id`, the driver creates a tagged sub-interface
on `upstream_interface` (for example `end0.905` when upstream is `end0` and
the VLAN is 905), assigns `public_ip` to that sub-interface, and generates
nftables NAT/forward rules against it instead of the untagged parent.

If `public_gateway` is also set, policy-based routing (PBR) forces traffic
from that DUT's private IP out via the VLAN: a default route in routing table
`<vlan_id>` and an `ip rule` matching the DUT source address.

`vlan_id` without `public_gateway` still creates the VLAN and NAT rules, but
logs a warning: without PBR, DUT traffic may not egress via the tagged
interface.

`public_gateway` without `vlan_id` is supported on the untagged upstream:
source-IP PBR uses routing table `int(<dut private IPv4>)`.

**Untagged source-IP PBR:**

```yaml
      addresses:
        - mac: "8a:12:4e:25:f4:8e"
          ip: "192.168.100.125"
          public_gateway: "203.0.113.254"
```

Omit both fields to keep today's untagged-upstream behaviour.

**1:1 NAT on a VLAN:**

```yaml
export:
  dut-network:
    type: jumpstarter_driver_dut_network.driver.DutNetwork
    config:
      interface: "enp1s0u1"
      subnet: "192.168.100.0/24"
      gateway_ip: "192.168.100.1"
      upstream_interface: "end0"
      nat_mode: "1to1"
      addresses:
        - mac: "8a:12:4e:25:f4:8e"
          ip: "192.168.100.125"
          hostname: "sa8775p"
          public_ip: "203.0.113.1"
          vlan_id: 905
          public_gateway: "203.0.113.254"
```

**Masquerade on a VLAN:**

```yaml
export:
  dut-network:
    type: jumpstarter_driver_dut_network.driver.DutNetwork
    config:
      interface: "enp1s0u1"
      subnet: "192.168.100.0/24"
      gateway_ip: "192.168.100.1"
      upstream_interface: "end0"
      nat_mode: "masquerade"
      addresses:
        - mac: "8a:12:4e:25:f4:8e"
          ip: "192.168.100.125"
          hostname: "sa8775p"
          public_ip: "203.0.113.1"
          vlan_id: 905
          public_gateway: "203.0.113.254"
```

Linux interface names are limited to 15 characters, so
`<upstream>.<vlan_id>` must fit that limit.  VLAN IDs 253–255 cannot be used
with `public_gateway` because those routing-table IDs are reserved by the kernel.

All address entries that share the same `vlan_id` share a single policy
routing table (keyed by the VLAN ID), so they **must use the same
`public_gateway`**. Configuring different gateways for entries on the same
VLAN is rejected at validation time. If different DUTs need different
gateways, put them on separate VLANs, or use untagged source-IP PBR
(`public_gateway` without `vlan_id`), which gives each DUT its own routing
table.

#### Mixed VLAN and untagged addresses

Tagged and untagged entries can coexist on the same exporter.  The
upstream (untagged) interface is **always** included in the masquerade
and forwarding rules so that unexpected or unregistered DUT hosts on
the bridge are still NATed via the default upstream.  VLAN
sub-interfaces are added when at least one address entry carries a
`vlan_id`.  Adding or removing addresses at runtime (via `add-address`
/ `remove-address`) triggers a full rebuild, so the rule set always
matches the current address list.


### Disabled NAT (DHCP only)

DHCP works normally but no NAT rules or IP forwarding are configured. Useful for pure L2 isolation or when routing is handled externally:

```yaml
export:
  dut-network:
    type: jumpstarter_driver_dut_network.driver.DutNetwork
    config:
      interface: "enx00e04c683af1"
      nat_mode: "disabled"   # also accepts "none"
      dhcp_enabled: true
```

### Custom DNS Entries

Register custom DNS records that dnsmasq will respond to. Useful for pointing DUTs at local services without a full DNS infrastructure:

```yaml
export:
  dut-network:
    type: jumpstarter_driver_dut_network.driver.DutNetwork
    config:
      interface: "eth2"
      nat_mode: "masquerade"
      dns_entries:
        - hostname: "controller.lab.local"
          ip: "198.51.100.1"
        - hostname: "registry.lab.local"
          ip: "198.51.100.2"
```

### Reference

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `interface` | str | *required* | Physical NIC for DUT connectivity (e.g., USB NIC name) |
| `subnet` | str | `192.168.100.0/24` | Private subnet for DUTs |
| `gateway_ip` | str | `192.168.100.1` | IP assigned to the interface (acts as gateway for DUTs) |

#### Address Entry Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|

| `hostname` | no | Hostname for DHCP |
| `public_ip` | no | Public IP for 1:1 NAT (per-entry). At least one entry must have `public_ip` when `nat_mode=1to1`. Also assigned to the VLAN sub-interface when `vlan_id` is set |
| `vlan_id` | no | 802.1Q VLAN ID (1–4094). When set, NAT uses `<upstream>.<vlan_id>` instead of the untagged upstream. Omit for untagged behaviour |

    entries = client.dut_network.get_dns_entries()
    client.dut_network.remove_dns_entry("myhost.lab.local")
```

## Architecture

The driver configures an isolated network for the DUT:

1. Takes over a dedicated Ethernet interface (e.g., USB NIC) and assigns a gateway IP directly to it
2. Runs dnsmasq to provide DHCP to DUTs connected to that interface
3. Configures nftables rules for NAT (masquerade or 1:1)
4. Enables IP forwarding so DUT traffic routes through the exporter

When NetworkManager is detected, the driver marks managed interfaces as `unmanaged` to prevent interference. On cleanup, existing addresses are flushed and the interface is restored to NetworkManager control.

## API Reference

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: jumpstarter_driver_dut_network.driver.DutNetwork()
```

```{note}
The driver uses a dedicated nftables table (named after the interface) that
does not conflict with firewalld or other nftables users.
```

## Known Limitations

```{warning}
This driver is designed for dedicated exporter hosts, not shared or
multi-purpose machines. The limitations below stem from that assumption.
```

- **One driver instance per host.** Running multiple instances of this
  driver on the same host (for example, multiple exporters sharing one
  sidekick) is not supported. Each instance assumes it owns any VLAN
  interfaces, PBR tables/rules, and nftables state matching its
  configuration, and cleanup does not distinguish between state created by
  itself versus another instance.

- **Cleanup is unconditional, not ownership-tracked.** On shutdown, the
  driver deletes every VLAN sub-interface, PBR rule, and nftables rule it is
  *configured* for — even if that resource already existed before the
  driver started (e.g. created by another tool or a previous unclean exit).
  This is intentional: it guarantees idempotent recreation after a crash,
  but it means the driver should not be pointed at interfaces or routing
  tables managed by anything else.

- **Same-VLAN entries must share one `public_gateway`.** All address
  entries with the same `vlan_id` route through a single shared PBR table
  (keyed by the VLAN ID). Different `public_gateway` values on the same
  VLAN are rejected at configuration validation. Use separate VLAN IDs, or
  untagged source-IP PBR, if independent per-DUT gateways are required.

- **Untagged PBR requires an IPv4 DUT address.** `public_gateway` without
  `vlan_id` derives the routing-table ID from `int(IPv4Address(ip))`, so the
  DUT's `ip` must be a valid IPv4 address in that case. VLAN-tagged PBR has
  no such restriction since it keys on `vlan_id` instead.

## Troubleshooting

### NAT traffic not forwarding (Docker hosts)

On hosts running Docker, the default iptables policy is often set to
`iptables -P FORWARD DROP` to isolate container networks.  Since modern
Linux translates iptables rules into nftables under the hood, this creates
a `table ip filter { chain FORWARD { policy drop } }` base chain that
**all** forwarded packets must pass - including traffic routed through
the DUT interface.

The driver **automatically** detects this situation using native nftables:
when NAT is enabled, it checks if the `ip filter` table's FORWARD chain
has `policy drop`.  If so, targeted `accept` rules are inserted directly
into that chain for the DUT and upstream interfaces on startup, and
removed by handle on cleanup.  No manual intervention or `iptables`
binary is required.

### Per-interface IP forwarding

The driver enables IPv4 forwarding only on the DUT and upstream
interfaces (`net.ipv4.conf.<iface>.forwarding=1`) rather than the global
`net.ipv4.ip_forward` sysctl.  This avoids turning a multi-homed host
into a full router on every interface.  If forwarding still does not work,
verify with:

```shell
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.<interface>.forwarding
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.<upstream>.forwarding
```

## Host System Side Effects

```{warning}
The DUT network driver modifies host networking state. It is designed for
dedicated exporter hosts or containers, **not** shared workstations or
laptops. Running it on a multi-purpose machine may interfere with other
network configurations.
```

The driver creates and removes several types of host-level networking
resources. Under normal operation these are cleaned up when the exporter
shuts down, but an unclean exit (crash, `kill -9`, power loss) will leave
them behind. Re-starting the exporter recreates the resources from
scratch, so orphaned state from a previous run is overwritten — but if
the exporter is never restarted, manual cleanup may be necessary.

### What the driver creates on the host

| Resource | Created when | Cleaned up on shutdown | Survives a crash |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **VLAN sub-interfaces** (e.g. `eth0.905`) | Address entry has `vlan_id` | Yes — deleted by `cleanup()` | Yes |
| **nftables table** (`jumpstarter_<iface>`) | NAT mode is not `disabled` | Yes — flushed on cleanup | Yes |
| **FORWARD chain accept rules** (in `ip filter`) | Docker sets FORWARD policy to `drop` | Yes — removed by handle | Yes |
| **IP forwarding sysctls** (`net.ipv4.conf.<iface>.forwarding`) | NAT mode is not `disabled` | Yes — restored to previous value | Yes |
| **IP aliases** (e.g. `203.0.113.1/24` on upstream) | 1:1 NAT with `public_ip` | Yes — removed on cleanup | Yes |
| **Policy routes and IP rules** | `public_gateway` is set | Yes — flushed on cleanup | Yes |
| **dnsmasq process** | DHCP is enabled | Yes — stopped on cleanup | No (orphan process) |

### Cleaning up after a crash

If the exporter crashes, the simplest recovery is to restart it — the
driver recreates all resources idempotently. To clean up manually:

```shell
# Remove orphan VLAN interfaces
sudo ip link del eth0.905

# Flush the driver's nftables table
sudo nft delete table ip jumpstarter_eth2

# Remove stale FORWARD chain rules (find handles first)
sudo nft -a list chain ip filter FORWARD | grep jmp
sudo nft delete rule ip filter FORWARD handle <N>

# Remove IP aliases
sudo ip addr del 203.0.113.1/24 dev eth0

# Flush policy routing tables
sudo ip route flush table 905
sudo ip rule del from 192.168.100.125 table 905

# Kill orphan dnsmasq
sudo pkill -f "dnsmasq.*jumpstarter"
```
