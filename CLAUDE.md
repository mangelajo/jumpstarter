# Claude AI Instructions

This file provides instructions for Claude AI when working with the Jumpstarter project.

## Project Rules and Guidelines

Important project-specific rules and guidelines are located in the `.claude/rules` directory:

- **`.claude/rules/project-structure.md`**: Understanding the monorepo structure, workspace configuration, package organization, and development workflows. Read this to understand how the project is organized and where files should be located.

- **`.claude/rules/creating-new-drivers.md`**: Guidelines for creating new driver packages, including naming conventions, required information, and the driver creation process. Read this when tasked with creating or modifying drivers.

- **`.claude/rules/releasing-operator.md`**: Step-by-step guide for releasing a new version of the Jumpstarter operator, including which files to update, image tag conventions, bundle generation, and community-operators contribution workflow.

- **`.claude/rules/jep-process.md`**: Process for creating Jumpstarter Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), including when to use them, numbering conventions, required sections, and the design decision format. Read this when proposing or reviewing cross-cutting changes or features that require community consensus.

- **`.claude/rules/e2e-doc-sync.md`**: Rules for keeping `e2e/README.md` aligned with E2E tests, runners, and CI labels (mirrors `.cursor/rules/e2e-doc-sync.mdc`). Read this when changing E2E behavior or E2E documentation.

## When to Read These Rules

- **Always**: Read `project-structure.md` when working with files, packages, or understanding the codebase layout
- **When creating drivers**: Read `creating-new-drivers.md` before creating, improving, or documenting driver packages
- **When releasing the operator**: Read `releasing-operator.md` before preparing a new operator version for OLM
- **When creating JEPs**: Read `jep-process.md` before proposing enhancements that affect multiple components, change public APIs, or require community discussion
- **When modifying E2E tests or E2E docs**: Read `e2e-doc-sync.md` and keep `e2e/README.md` synchronized in the same PR
- **When modifying structure**: Consult both files when making changes that affect project organization

## Key Information

- All Python code is located under the `python/` directory
- The project uses UV workspace for dependency management
- Driver creation script: `./python/__templates__/create_driver.sh`
- Testing: Use `make pkg-test-<package_name>` for package-specific tests
- Linting: Use `make lint-fix` to fix linting issues
- Type checking: Use `make pkg-ty-<package_name>` for type checking

Please refer to the detailed rules in `.claude/rules/` for comprehensive guidance.
