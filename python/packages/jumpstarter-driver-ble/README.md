# BLE Driver

`jumpstarter-driver-ble` provides communication functionality via ble with the DUT.
The driver expects a ble service with a write and notify characteristic to send and receive data respectively.

## Installation

```{code-block} console
:substitutions:
$ pip3 install --extra-index-url {{index_url}} jumpstarter-driver-ble
```

## Configuration

Example configuration:

```yaml
export:
  ble:
    type: "jumpstarter_driver_ble.driver.BleWriteNotifyStream"
